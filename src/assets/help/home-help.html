                  <p>
                    The product is shipped with an initial Home dashboard that contains a word cloud of top key phrases, a sentiment trend, top topics, IVR and ACD Interaction counts, AHT in seconds and the AHT trend by day in a bar chart.   If you have not made any calls, there may not be data yet in your setup.  Please wait a few hours and make some test calls to ensure data is flowing through from your contact center to the visualizations.   This dashboard can be easily configured and customized to your preferences in the Customize dashboard settings or new visualizations can be selected from the Analytics tab.  From this dossier, you can explore the library, you can examine the dossier or return to the main dossier by clicking on Home dashboard again.  If you make changes to the dossier, you can hit the “reset” clock icon at the top to return to initial settings.  You can also change the time period by clicking on the “?” re-prompt. You can share this dossier by pdf or to other users by clicking file and then share in the top left of the dossier.
