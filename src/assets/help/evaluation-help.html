                    You first arrive in the Evaluation workspace which acts as an inbox for your conversation evaluations.   The top panel is your selection area.  The bottom section is your work area.  If there are no evaluations in your Evaluation workspace, you can put evaluations here by clicking on the Interactions tab or by building a Playbook with an action to push calls to a specific Evaluation forms.

                <p> 
                    In the Sort interactions area, you can select a specific Evaluation form.  The area is set up by “forms” so that you are always working on one specific type of QA work.  To change the form (and related calls) used for evaluation, access the pull-down menu “Evaluation form applied.”  Once selected you can further refine your search by date, by Agent name, or by Queue.  Click Refresh results to refine your search.  The conversations that meet your selection criteria then appear in the “Select interactions for evaluation” area in the right side of the top panel.  You can select any call in this selection area and it will then appear for evaluation below in the Interaction Player and the appropriate evaluation form will appear ready for completion.

                    The interaction player allows you to see and hear conversations at the same time.  You can pause, start, and move around in the call as needed.   The media player shows the transcript for the related call under the Transcript tab located below the Interaction player.  The Topics tab allows you to see key topics and key phrases including where they appear in the call. You can “jump” to the related portion of the conversation by clicking on the keyword.

                    The Evaluation Form on the right-hand side shows the set of criteria and questions that have been established by you and your management team for this type of call / conversation evaluation.   As you work through the call listening, you can provide your scores for each question and hit save when you are done.  Saved evaluations become available for reports and dashboards for agents, supervisors, and other reporting needs.

                    <p>Each form is set up by category area.

                    <p>Each category can have multiple questions.  You can add as many questions as you like under each category.  Once you add a question, you can type in the question and then select the response type.

                <p>There are two ways to get interactions into the Evaluation workspace:  <span>Playbooks</span> and this <span>Interactions</span> tab. This tab is an active search tool that allows you to explore conversations and to trigger an action to push the calls into the appropriate evaluation workspace.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The search tool allows you to select calls by date range, call queue, agent name, topic (See: Playbooks), key phrase (see playbooks).

                    <br>
                    From there you can select a specific Evaluation Workspace and then click “Send to Evaluation Workspace” and this call will be placed in the Evaluation room.Calls can also be automatically sent to an evaluation workspace by creating <span>Playbooks</span> to move them on a per call basis immediately after the conversation is logged to the data warehouse.
