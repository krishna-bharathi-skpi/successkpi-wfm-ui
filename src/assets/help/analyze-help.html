                    From Analytics, you can navigate back to Home, Evaluations, Playbooks, and Settings. To work within the Analytics area, use the side navigation for Key questions, Shared Dashboards, Custom Reports, Subscriptions, and this Help tab. You can collapse the side navigation with the side arrow at the top of the gray panel.

                    The initial landing place for Analytics is Key Questions.  Here you will find up to 12 tiles /cards designed to give easy access to analytics reports and visualizations important to your business.  Each tile is a gateway to information in a specific area and has four main attributes:  Card Number/character (maximum 2 characters), Title (max 30 characters), a Question designed to make the visualization more approachable and acts as a subtitle and a Report Handle which is a destination to an underlying dashboard, report or visualization.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Customized for your work group, each question represents a dashboard configured to a particular topic or area of business.

                        <br>
                        Administrators and analysts can change key question details from the Edit mode, accessed with the “Edit Key Questions” button at the top right of the page. Click save or cancel when done editing a specific card.   When complete with edits, return to locked mode by pressing this button again now titled: “Back to Locked Mode”

                        When you click on Shared Dashboards you enter the analytics library provided by SuccessKPI. Each of the yellow folders (e.g. ACD, IVR, Journeys) contains prebuilt reports and visualizations designed to meet certain needs of our contact center customers.   You can use these reports “as is” or convert them to customer reports by using “Save As...”.  To use a report, navigate through the folders, click on the report, select the time period for this report, click “Run Dossier” at the bottom left and begin exploring the data.  You can make any changes you want and exit without saving or “Save As...”  to make a custom report.

                        Any shared dashboards that you “Save As” in a new version will appear in your Custom Reports tab.  You can access your personal report folders and arrange or re-configure them for your team or organization.  You can also create dashboard from scratch from within this area of the product by clicking on the “Create” button which allows you to create new dossers, reports, and documents.  You can also use this menu to create new metrics and filters and to add external data.

                        <br>
                        You can add new visualizations to any dossier including Grid, Heat Map, Graph, Network, Histogram, Box Plot, Waterfall, Map, and KPI.  You can even add custom visualizations.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Within each dossier or report, you can make limitless changes to datasets, combine data, and add, delete or move visualizations around the report using the point and click interface.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Once you have made the changes and saved your dossier you can later link any document or dossier to the key questions tab in the Edit Mode as described above.  Simply right click on the document in the file folder, select Properties and copy the documents “ID” string and paste it into the Report Handle field from the Edit Key Questions mode for the destination card.

                    <p>The Subscriptions tab allows you to manage previously created subscriptions and to create new subscriptions.  When you enter the Subscriptions tab you will see dossiers that are already subscribed (if any).  To unsubscribe, simply click unsubscribe.  To create or edit a subscription, navigate to the appropriate folder (Shared Reports or My Reports), and select a dossier.  Run the dossier for the desired time interval. Then click on File, Schedule Delivery to E-mail (or to History List).  Here you can select the recipient, any subject or message to be delivered with the PDF of the report, and the recipient name or distribution list.  Once created, subscriptions can later be found in the list of “My Subscriptions” at the root of the Subscriptions Menu.</p>
